On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\n5.2 Working with visual geometrics\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. This default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Working with layout\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"shade\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Working with mixed layout\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Combining corrgram with the significant test\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6 Reorder a corrgram\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7 Reordering a correlation matrix using hclust\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         lower = \"ellipse\", \n         upper = \"number\",\n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

    "text": "2. Bayes Factor\n\n2.1 Unpacking the Bayes Factor\n\nA Bayes Factor (BF) is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThe Bayes Factor provides a way to evaluate data in favor of a null hypothesis and to incorporate external information in doing so. It quantifies the weight of the evidence in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen comparing two hypotheses, \\(H_1\\) (the alternative hypothesis) and \\(H_0\\) (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as \\(BF_{10}\\). Mathematically, it is defined as:\n\\[\nBF_{10} = \\frac{P(D \\mid H_1)}{P(D \\mid H_0)}\n\\]\n\nwhere:\n\n\\(P(D \\mid H_1)\\) is the probability of the observed data given that the alternative hypothesis is true.\n\\(P(D \\mid H_0)\\) is the probability of the observed data given that the null hypothesis is true.\nA Bayes Factor greater than 1 indicates evidence in favor of \\(H_1\\), while a Bayes Factor less than 1 supports \\(H_0\\).\n\nThe Schwarz criterion (Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC) is one of the simplest ways to approximate the Bayes Factor.\n\n\n2.2 How to interpret Bayes Factor\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number. One of the most common interpretations is this one—first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagenmakers in 2013:"

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n4.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Note how simple the syntax used to create the plot!\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n/ operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n| operator to place the plots beside each other,\n() operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Creating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 Creating figure with inset\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()"

Grammar of Graphics\nGrammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to:\n\nGain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978).\nProvide a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics.\nGuide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like.\n\nNote: there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics."

    "text": "5. Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: geom\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:\n\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.\nFor complete list, please refer to here.\n\n\n5.1 Geometric Objects: geom_bar\nThe code chunk below plots a bar chart by using geom_bar().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Geometric Objects: geom_dotplot\nIn a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.\nIn the code chunk below, geom_dotplot() of ggplot2 is used to plot a dot plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the parameters:\n\nbinwidth: The default binwidth is 1.\n\nEach bin will cover an interval of 1 unit on the x-axis.\nFor example, if your x-axis represents test scores ranging from 0 to 100, the bins will be [0-1), [1-2), [2-3), …, [99-100).\nbinwidth = 2.5 means that test scores are grouped into intervals of 2.5 units e.g. [0-2.5), [2.5, 5)…\n\nscale_y_continuous() is used to turn off the y-axis.\n\nThe range of y-axis is 0-1 which can can potentially distort the interpretation of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Geometric Objects: geom_histogram\nIn the code chunk below, geom_histogram() is used to create a simple histogram by using values in MATHS field of exam_data.\n\nggplot(data = exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default bin is 30. By setting bins = 25, the number of bins is consistent with the test scores along the x-axis.\n\n\n5.4 Modifying a geometric object by changing geom()\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nbins argument is used to change the number of bins to 25,\nfill argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and\ncolor argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20,            \n                 color=\"black\",      \n                 fill=\"light blue\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Modifying a geometric object by changing aes()\nThe code chunk below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. fill) by using sub-group of aesthetic().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"grey30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach can be used to colour, fill and alpha of the geometric.\n\n\n5.6 Geometric Objects: geom-density()\ngeom-density() computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.\nIt is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\nThe code below plots the distribution of MATHS scores in a kernel density estimate plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots two kernel density lines by using colour or fill arguments of aes()\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7 Geometric Objects: geom_boxplot()\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\nThe code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of MATHS scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.8 Geometric Objects: geom_violin()\ngeom_violin() is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.9 Geometric Objects: geom_point()\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.10 geom objects can be combined\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)"

    "text": "2. Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n2.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that two steps are involved.\n\nFirst, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph.\nThen, girafe() will be used to generate an svg (scalable vector graphics) object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\n2.2 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID and Class will be displayed.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.\n\n\n2.3 Customising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:white; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #&lt;&lt;\n    opts_tooltip(    #&lt;&lt;\n      css = tooltip_css)) #&lt;&lt;\n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.

    "section": "2. Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot",
    "text": "2. Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n2.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nggplot(exam_data, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nVarying fill coloursTransparency\n\n\n\nggplot(exam_data, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"English score\",\n                       option = \"C\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam_data, aes(x = ENGLISH, y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    fill = \"blue\",      # Choose a constant fill color\n    alpha = 0.5         # Set transparency level (0 = fully transparent, 1 = opaque)\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(\n    name = NULL,\n    expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))\n  ) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Mapping the probabilities directly onto colour\nBeside providing additional geom objects to support the need to plot ridgeline plot, ggridges package also provides a stat function called stat_density_ridges() that replaces stat_density() of ggplot2.\nFigure below is plotted by mapping the probabilities calculated by using stat(ecdf) which represent the empirical cumulative density function for the distribution of English score.\n\nggplot(exam_data,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +\n  stat_density_ridges(geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\", \n                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Tail probability\",\n                       direction = -1) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is important include the argument calc_ecdf = TRUE in stat_density_ridges().\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Ridgeline plots with quantile lines\nBy using geom_density_ridges_gradient(), we can colour the ridgeline plot by quantile, via the calculated stat(quantile) aesthetic as shown in the figure below.\n\nggplot(exam_data,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = 4,\n    quantile_lines = TRUE) +\n  # Use a brewer scale with pastel colors and custom labels for the quartiles\n  scale_fill_brewer(name = \"Quartile Range\", \n                    palette = \"Pastel1\", \n                    labels = c(\"0–25%\", \"25–50%\", \"50–75%\", \"75–100%\")) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n        panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey85\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using number to define the quantiles, we can also specify quantiles by cut points such as 2.5% and 97.5% tails to colour the ridgeline plot as shown in the figure below.\n\nggplot(exam_data,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS, \n           fill = factor(stat(quantile))\n           )) +\n  stat_density_ridges(\n    geom = \"density_ridges_gradient\",\n    calc_ecdf = TRUE, \n    quantiles = c(0.025, 0.975)\n    ) +\n  # Use more visually appealing muted colors with transparency\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    name = \"Probability\",\n    values = c(\"#D55E00A0\",  # Muted orange\n               \"#999999A0\",  # Soft gray\n               \"#0072B2A0\"), # Muted blue\n    labels = c(\"(0, 0.025]\", \"(0.025, 0.975]\", \"(0.975, 1]\")\n  ) +\n  # Softer theme with a light background for better contrast\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"grey80\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA),\n    legend.key = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = NA)\n  )"

    "text": "3. Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n3.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nggplot(exam_data, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n3.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nggplot(exam_data, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3 Adding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nggplot(exam_data, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Finishing touch\n\nggplot(exam_data, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()"

You can manually choose a palette using the palette argument.\n\nExample: “RdYlBu”\n\ntreemap(\n  realis2018_selected,\n  index = c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n  vSize = \"Total Unit Sold\",\n  vColor = \"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n  type = \"value\",\n  palette = \"RdYlBu\",\n  title = \"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2018\",\n  title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause our values are all positive, you may not see the full gradient (e.g., no reds if all prices are above zero).\n\n\n\n3.5 “manual” Type\nWith type = \"manual\", the data is linearly mapped onto the palette. A single-hue palette like “Blues” is more intuitive if all values are positive.\n\ntreemap(\n  realis2018_selected,\n  index = c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n  vSize = \"Total Unit Sold\",\n  vColor = \"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n  type = \"manual\",\n  palette = \"Blues\",\n  title = \"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2018\",\n  title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Treemap Layout Algorithms\n\n“pivotSize” (default) respects the order of the data but is slightly less balanced visually.\n“squarified” often produces more balanced aspect ratios.\n\n\ntreemap(\n  realis2018_selected,\n  index = c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n  vSize = \"Total Unit Sold\",\n  vColor = \"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n  type = \"manual\",\n  palette = \"Blues\",\n  algorithm = \"squarified\",\n  title = \"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2018\",\n  title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing sortID\nWhen using \"pivotSize\", you can specify sortID to control the rectangle order:\n\ntreemap(\n  realis2018_selected,\n  index = c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n  vSize = \"Total Unit Sold\",\n  vColor = \"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n  type = \"manual\",\n  palette = \"Blues\",\n  algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n  sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n  title = \"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2018\",\n  title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n)"

More exploration\n\n6.1 Adding Labels Inside Treemap (treemapify)\nYou can add text labels to each rectangle using geom_treemap_text():\n\nggplot(\n  data = realis2018_selected,\n  aes(\n    area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n    fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n    label = `Planning Area`\n  )\n) + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  geom_treemap_text(\n    colour = \"white\",\n    place = \"centre\",\n    grow = TRUE\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"blue\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Treemap with Labels (Planning Area)\",\n    fill = \"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Filtering for Top N Areas\nSuppose you only want to visualize the top 10 Planning Areas by Total Unit Sold:\n\ntop10_areas &lt;- realis2018_selected %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Planning Area`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(total_unit_sold = sum(`Total Unit Sold`)) %&gt;%\n  slice_max(order_by = total_unit_sold, n = 10) %&gt;%\n  pull(`Planning Area`)\n\ntop10_data &lt;- realis2018_selected %&gt;%\n  filter(`Planning Area` %in% top10_areas)\n\nggplot(\n  data = top10_data,\n  aes(\n    area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n    fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n    label = `Planning Area`\n  )\n) +\n  geom_treemap() +\n  geom_treemap_text(colour = \"white\", place = \"centre\", grow = TRUE) +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Planning Areas by Total Unit Sold (2018)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Comparing Two Property Types Side by Side\nYou can create two treemaps and place them side by side using patchwork or cowplot. For instance, comparing Condominium vs. Executive Condominium:\n\npacman::p_load(patchwork)\n\ncondo_data &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\")\n\nec_data &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Executive Condominium\")\n\nplot_condo &lt;- ggplot(\n  data = condo_data,\n  aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`, fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`)\n) + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  labs(title = \"Condominium\")\n\nplot_ec &lt;- ggplot(\n  data = ec_data,\n  aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`, fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`)\n) + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  labs(title = \"Executive Condominium\")\n\nplot_condo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_ec\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.4 Highlighting Specific Regions (Conditional Coloring)\nYou might want to color certain regions differently if they meet certain criteria, e.g., a Median Unit Price above $20,000 psm:\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_selected %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    PriceCategory = if_else(\n      `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` &gt; 20000, \n      \"High Price\", \n      \"Others\"\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(\n  data = realis2018_selected,\n  aes(\n    area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n    fill = PriceCategory\n  )\n) + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"High Price\" = \"red\", \"Others\" = \"grey70\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Conditional Coloring: High vs. Other Price Levels\",\n    fill = \"Price Category\"\n  )"

In essence, the model cannot reliably discern each variable’s true contribution, leading to artificially low VIF point estimates paired with massive uncertainty bounds.\n\n\nConfusion Matrix:\n\n\n\nThe matrix shows 0 true positives.\nThis is typical when a logistic model either encounters near-complete separation or opts to disregard the minority class in imbalanced datasets.\n\n\nROC Curve:\n\n\n\nThe ROC curve lies near the diagonal reference line, confirming that the model lacks predictive power and is essentially guessing."

contains no missing values, and the categorical variables have a maximum of 4 unique values. Converting these variables into factors ensures they are correctly treated as categorical data during analysis and visualization.\n\n# Convert selected categorical variables into factors\nheart_data &lt;- heart_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Gender = as.factor(Gender),\n    Region = as.factor(Region),\n    Smoking_History = as.factor(Smoking_History),\n    Diabetes_History = as.factor(Diabetes_History),\n    Hypertension_History = as.factor(Hypertension_History),\n    Physical_Activity = as.factor(Physical_Activity),\n    Diet_Quality = as.factor(Diet_Quality),\n    Alcohol_Consumption = as.factor(Alcohol_Consumption),\n    Family_History = as.factor(Family_History),\n    Heart_Attack_Occurrence = as.factor(Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\n  )\n\n\n\nDrop extra columns\n\n# Select only the Extra_Columns and the outcome variable\nextra_data &lt;- heart_data %&gt;%\n  select(starts_with(\"Extra_Column_\"), Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\n\n# Reshape to long format\nextra_data_long &lt;- melt(extra_data, id.vars = \"Heart_Attack_Occurrence\")\n\n# Create boxplots comparing each Extra_Column by Heart_Attack_Occurrence\nggplot(extra_data_long, aes(x = Heart_Attack_Occurrence, y = value)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Extra Columns by Heart Attack Occurrence\",\n    x = \"Heart Attack Occurrence\",\n    y = \"Value\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince these variables do not appear to vary by heart attack status, they are unlikely to provide useful information for any downstream analysis (e.g., modeling, hypothesis testing). Dropping them will simplify the dataset and help focus on variables that do relate to heart attack risk.\nWe can drop them with the following code:\n\nheart_data &lt;- heart_data %&gt;%\n  select(-starts_with(\"Extra_Column_\"))\n\n\n\nCleaned dataset\n\nglimpse(heart_data)\n\nRows: 30,000\nColumns: 17\n$ Age                     &lt;dbl&gt; 56, 69, 46, 32, 60, 25, 78, 38, 56, 75, 36, 40…\n$ Gender                  &lt;fct&gt; Male, Male, Male, Female, Female, Female, Male…\n$ Region                  &lt;fct&gt; Urban, Urban, Rural, Urban, Rural, Rural, Urba…\n$ Smoking_History         &lt;fct&gt; Yes, No, Yes, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, No, No,…\n$ Diabetes_History        &lt;fct&gt; No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, No, No, No, N…\n$ Hypertension_History    &lt;fct&gt; No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, Yes, No, Yes,…\n$ Cholesterol_Level       &lt;dbl&gt; 186.4002, 185.1367, 210.6966, 211.1655, 223.81…\n$ Physical_Activity       &lt;fct&gt; Moderate, Low, Low, Moderate, High, Low, High,…\n$ Diet_Quality            &lt;fct&gt; Poor, Good, Average, Good, Good, Good, Poor, P…\n$ Alcohol_Consumption     &lt;fct&gt; Low, Low, Moderate, High, High, High, High, No…\n$ Stress_Levels           &lt;dbl&gt; 3.644786, 3.384056, 3.810911, 6.014878, 6.8068…\n$ BMI                     &lt;dbl&gt; 33.96135, 28.24287, 27.60121, 23.71729, 19.771…\n$ Heart_Rate              &lt;dbl&gt; 72.30153, 57.45764, 64.65870, 55.13147, 76.667…\n$ Systolic_BP             &lt;dbl&gt; 123.90209, 129.89331, 145.65490, 131.78522, 10…\n$ Diastolic_BP            &lt;dbl&gt; 85.68281, 73.52426, 71.99481, 68.21133, 92.902…\n$ Family_History          &lt;fct&gt; No, Yes, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, Yes,…\n$ Heart_Attack_Occurrence &lt;fct&gt; No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, No, N…"

The width of each bar segment corresponds to the relative size of that demographic group, while the height indicates the proportion of individuals who experienced a heart attack.\nOverall, heart attack rates remain relatively consistent between rural and urban areas. However, males tend to have a higher probability of heart attack than females, regardless of age or region.\n\n\n\nMosaic plot: Lifestyle factors\nWe create a mosaic plot with SmokeAct on the x-axis, color by heart attack occurrence, and facet by the four alcohol consumption levels.\n\n# Reorder factor levels for Alcohol_Consumption\nheart_data_eda &lt;- heart_data_eda %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Alcohol_Consumption = factor(\n      Alcohol_Consumption,\n      levels = c(\"High\", \"Moderate\", \"Low\", \"None\")\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(heart_data_eda) +\n  geom_mosaic(aes(\n    x    = product(SmokeAct),\n    fill = Heart_Attack_Occurrence\n  ), alpha = 0.9) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Alcohol_Consumption, ncol = 2) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#F1B1B5\", \"Yes\" = \"#97B3AE\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Lifestyle Mosaic: Smoking, Activity, and Alcohol vs. Heart Attack\",\n    subtitle = \"PA = Physical Activity.

Each facet represents a different alcohol consumption level (High, Moderate, Low, None).\nInterestingly, non-smokers who report no alcohol consumption but high physical activity exhibit one of the highest heart attack rates. Additionally, smokers with moderate physical activity tend to have higher heart attack rates compared to smokers with low or high physical activity.\n\n\n\nPairwise numeric plot (Health metrics)\nThis code uses ggpairs() to create a matrix of pairwise plots for all numeric variables in heart_data. The mapping = aes(color = Heart_Attack_Occurrence) argument adds a color-coded grouping by heart attack status.\n\n# Automatically select all numeric columns from the dataset\nnumeric_cols &lt;- sapply(heart_data, is.numeric)\n\npairwise_plot &lt;- ggpairs(\n  data = heart_data,\n  columns = which(numeric_cols),\n  mapping = aes(color = Heart_Attack_Occurrence),\n  lower = list(continuous = wrap(\"smooth\", alpha = 0.3, size = 0.5)),\n  diag = list(continuous = wrap(\"densityDiag\", alpha = 0.5)),\n  upper = list(continuous = wrap(\"cor\", size = 4))\n) +\n  ggtitle(\"Pairwise Correlations Among All Numeric Metrics\")\n\npairwise_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the plot\nThis grid compares health metrics like BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and stress. The diagonal panels show density curves for each variable, revealing, for instance, that Age has a broader distribution compared to the other variables.\nThe upper panels list correlation coefficients and their significance, most of which are near zero (e.g., Corr: 0.025, 0.048), indicating that these variables do not strongly co-vary. In the lower scatter plots, points are colored by heart attack occurrence; no tight clustering suggests no single numeric threshold exclusively separates “Yes” vs. “No.” For instance, Systolic_BP and Diastolic_BP show little correlation as high Systolic_BP often coexists with both high and low Diastolic_BP. Overall, no single numeric factor stands out as a strictly linear driver of heart attack, though there may be subtle nonlinear or interactive effects to explore later."

contains no missing values, and the categorical variables have a maximum of 4 unique values. Converting these variables into factors ensures they are correctly treated as categorical data during analysis and visualization.\n\n# Convert selected categorical variables into factors\nheart_data &lt;- heart_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Gender = as.factor(Gender),\n    Region = as.factor(Region),\n    Smoking_History = as.factor(Smoking_History),\n    Diabetes_History = as.factor(Diabetes_History),\n    Hypertension_History = as.factor(Hypertension_History),\n    Physical_Activity = as.factor(Physical_Activity),\n    Diet_Quality = as.factor(Diet_Quality),\n    Alcohol_Consumption = as.factor(Alcohol_Consumption),\n    Family_History = as.factor(Family_History),\n    Heart_Attack_Occurrence = as.factor(Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\n  )\n\n\n\nDrop extra columns\n\n# Select only the Extra_Columns and the outcome variable\nextra_data &lt;- heart_data %&gt;%\n  select(starts_with(\"Extra_Column_\"), Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\n\n# Reshape to long format\nextra_data_long &lt;- melt(extra_data, id.vars = \"Heart_Attack_Occurrence\")\n\n# Create boxplots comparing each Extra_Column by Heart_Attack_Occurrence\nggplot(extra_data_long, aes(x = Heart_Attack_Occurrence, y = value)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Extra Columns by Heart Attack Occurrence\",\n    x = \"Heart Attack Occurrence\",\n    y = \"Value\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince these variables do not appear to vary by heart attack status, they are unlikely to provide useful information for any downstream analysis (e.g., modeling, hypothesis testing). Dropping them will simplify the dataset and help focus on variables that do relate to heart attack risk.\nWe can drop them with the following code:\n\nheart_data &lt;- heart_data %&gt;%\n  select(-starts_with(\"Extra_Column_\"))\n\n\n\nCleaned dataset\n\nglimpse(heart_data)\n\nRows: 30,000\nColumns: 17\n$ Age                     &lt;dbl&gt; 56, 69, 46, 32, 60, 25, 78, 38, 56, 75, 36, 40…\n$ Gender                  &lt;fct&gt; Male, Male, Male, Female, Female, Female, Male…\n$ Region                  &lt;fct&gt; Urban, Urban, Rural, Urban, Rural, Rural, Urba…\n$ Smoking_History         &lt;fct&gt; Yes, No, Yes, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, No, No,…\n$ Diabetes_History        &lt;fct&gt; No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, No, No, No, N…\n$ Hypertension_History    &lt;fct&gt; No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, Yes, No, Yes,…\n$ Cholesterol_Level       &lt;dbl&gt; 186.4002, 185.1367, 210.6966, 211.1655, 223.81…\n$ Physical_Activity       &lt;fct&gt; Moderate, Low, Low, Moderate, High, Low, High,…\n$ Diet_Quality            &lt;fct&gt; Poor, Good, Average, Good, Good, Good, Poor, P…\n$ Alcohol_Consumption     &lt;fct&gt; Low, Low, Moderate, High, High, High, High, No…\n$ Stress_Levels           &lt;dbl&gt; 3.644786, 3.384056, 3.810911, 6.014878, 6.8068…\n$ BMI                     &lt;dbl&gt; 33.96135, 28.24287, 27.60121, 23.71729, 19.771…\n$ Heart_Rate              &lt;dbl&gt; 72.30153, 57.45764, 64.65870, 55.13147, 76.667…\n$ Systolic_BP             &lt;dbl&gt; 123.90209, 129.89331, 145.65490, 131.78522, 10…\n$ Diastolic_BP            &lt;dbl&gt; 85.68281, 73.52426, 71.99481, 68.21133, 92.902…\n$ Family_History          &lt;fct&gt; No, Yes, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, Yes,…\n$ Heart_Attack_Occurrence &lt;fct&gt; No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, No, N…"

The width of each bar segment corresponds to the relative size of that demographic group, while the height indicates the proportion of individuals who experienced a heart attack.\nOverall, heart attack rates remain relatively consistent between rural and urban areas. However, males tend to have a higher probability of heart attack than females, regardless of age or region.\n\n\nMosaic plot: Lifestyle factors\nWe create a mosaic plot with SmokeAct on the x-axis, color by heart attack occurrence, and facet by the four alcohol consumption levels.\n\n# Reorder factor levels for Alcohol_Consumption\nheart_data_eda &lt;- heart_data_eda %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Alcohol_Consumption = factor(\n      Alcohol_Consumption,\n      levels = c(\"High\", \"Moderate\", \"Low\", \"None\")\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(heart_data_eda) +\n  geom_mosaic(aes(\n    x    = product(SmokeAct),\n    fill = Heart_Attack_Occurrence\n  ), alpha = 0.9) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Alcohol_Consumption, ncol = 2) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#F1B1B5\", \"Yes\" = \"#97B3AE\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Lifestyle Mosaic: Smoking, Activity, and Alcohol vs. Heart Attack\",\n    subtitle = \"PA = Physical Activity.

Each facet represents a different alcohol consumption level (High, Moderate, Low, None).\nInterestingly, non-smokers who report no alcohol consumption but high physical activity exhibit one of the highest heart attack rates. Additionally, smokers with moderate physical activity tend to have higher heart attack rates compared to smokers with low or high physical activity.\n\n\nPairwise numeric plot (Health metrics)\nThis code uses ggpairs() to create a matrix of pairwise plots for all numeric variables in heart_data. The mapping = aes(color = Heart_Attack_Occurrence) argument adds a color-coded grouping by heart attack status.\n\n# Automatically select all numeric columns from the dataset\nnumeric_cols &lt;- sapply(heart_data, is.numeric)\n\npairwise_plot &lt;- ggpairs(\n  data = heart_data,\n  columns = which(numeric_cols),\n  mapping = aes(color = Heart_Attack_Occurrence),\n  lower = list(continuous = wrap(\"smooth\", alpha = 0.3, size = 0.5)),\n  diag = list(continuous = wrap(\"densityDiag\", alpha = 0.5)),\n  upper = list(continuous = wrap(\"cor\", size = 4))\n) +\n  ggtitle(\"Pairwise Correlations Among All Numeric Metrics\")\n\npairwise_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the plot\nThis grid compares health metrics like BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and stress. The diagonal panels show density curves for each variable, revealing, for instance, that Age has a broader distribution compared to the other variables.\nThe upper panels list correlation coefficients and their significance, most of which are near zero (e.g., Corr: 0.025, 0.048), indicating that these variables do not strongly co-vary. In the lower scatter plots, points are colored by heart attack occurrence; no tight clustering suggests no single numeric threshold exclusively separates “Yes” vs. “No.” For instance, Systolic_BP and Diastolic_BP show little correlation as high Systolic_BP often coexists with both high and low Diastolic_BP. Overall, no single numeric factor stands out as a strictly linear driver of heart attack, though there may be subtle nonlinear or interactive effects to explore later."

contains no missing values, and the categorical variables have a maximum of 4 unique values. Converting these variables into factors ensures they are correctly treated as categorical data during analysis and visualization.\n\n# Convert selected categorical variables into factors\nheart_data &lt;- heart_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Gender = as.factor(Gender),\n    Region = as.factor(Region),\n    Smoking_History = as.factor(Smoking_History),\n    Diabetes_History = as.factor(Diabetes_History),\n    Hypertension_History = as.factor(Hypertension_History),\n    Physical_Activity = as.factor(Physical_Activity),\n    Diet_Quality = as.factor(Diet_Quality),\n    Alcohol_Consumption = as.factor(Alcohol_Consumption),\n    Family_History = as.factor(Family_History),\n    Heart_Attack_Occurrence = as.factor(Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\n  )\n\n\n\nDrop extra columns\n\n# Select only the Extra_Columns and the outcome variable\nextra_data &lt;- heart_data %&gt;%\n  select(starts_with(\"Extra_Column_\"), Heart_Attack_Occurrence)\n\n# Reshape to long format\nextra_data_long &lt;- melt(extra_data, id.vars = \"Heart_Attack_Occurrence\")\n\n# Create boxplots comparing each Extra_Column by Heart_Attack_Occurrence\nggplot(extra_data_long, aes(x = Heart_Attack_Occurrence, y = value)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Extra Columns by Heart Attack Occurrence\",\n    x = \"Heart Attack Occurrence\",\n    y = \"Value\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince these variables do not appear to vary by heart attack status, they are unlikely to provide useful information for any downstream analysis (e.g., modeling, hypothesis testing). Dropping them will simplify the dataset and help focus on variables that do relate to heart attack risk.\nWe can drop them with the following code:\n\nheart_data &lt;- heart_data %&gt;%\n  select(-starts_with(\"Extra_Column_\"))\n\n\n\nCleaned dataset\n\nglimpse(heart_data)\n\nRows: 30,000\nColumns: 17\n$ Age                     &lt;dbl&gt; 56, 69, 46, 32, 60, 25, 78, 38, 56, 75, 36, 40…\n$ Gender                  &lt;fct&gt; Male, Male, Male, Female, Female, Female, Male…\n$ Region                  &lt;fct&gt; Urban, Urban, Rural, Urban, Rural, Rural, Urba…\n$ Smoking_History         &lt;fct&gt; Yes, No, Yes, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, No, No,…\n$ Diabetes_History        &lt;fct&gt; No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, No, No, No, N…\n$ Hypertension_History    &lt;fct&gt; No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, Yes, No, Yes,…\n$ Cholesterol_Level       &lt;dbl&gt; 186.4002, 185.1367, 210.6966, 211.1655, 223.81…\n$ Physical_Activity       &lt;fct&gt; Moderate, Low, Low, Moderate, High, Low, High,…\n$ Diet_Quality            &lt;fct&gt; Poor, Good, Average, Good, Good, Good, Poor, P…\n$ Alcohol_Consumption     &lt;fct&gt; Low, Low, Moderate, High, High, High, High, No…\n$ Stress_Levels           &lt;dbl&gt; 3.644786, 3.384056, 3.810911, 6.014878, 6.8068…\n$ BMI                     &lt;dbl&gt; 33.96135, 28.24287, 27.60121, 23.71729, 19.771…\n$ Heart_Rate              &lt;dbl&gt; 72.30153, 57.45764, 64.65870, 55.13147, 76.667…\n$ Systolic_BP             &lt;dbl&gt; 123.90209, 129.89331, 145.65490, 131.78522, 10…\n$ Diastolic_BP            &lt;dbl&gt; 85.68281, 73.52426, 71.99481, 68.21133, 92.902…\n$ Family_History          &lt;fct&gt; No, Yes, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, Yes,…\n$ Heart_Attack_Occurrence &lt;fct&gt; No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, Yes, No, No, N…"

The width of each bar segment corresponds to the relative size of that demographic group, while the height indicates the proportion of individuals who experienced a heart attack.\nOverall, heart attack rates remain relatively consistent between rural and urban areas. However, males tend to have a higher probability of heart attack than females, regardless of age or region.\n\n\n\nMosaic plot: Lifestyle factors\nWe create a mosaic plot with SmokeAct on the x-axis, color by heart attack occurrence, and facet by the four alcohol consumption levels.\n\n# Reorder factor levels for Alcohol_Consumption\nheart_data_eda &lt;- heart_data_eda %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Alcohol_Consumption = factor(\n      Alcohol_Consumption,\n      levels = c(\"High\", \"Moderate\", \"Low\", \"None\")\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot(heart_data_eda) +\n  geom_mosaic(aes(\n    x    = product(SmokeAct),\n    fill = Heart_Attack_Occurrence\n  ), alpha = 0.9) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Alcohol_Consumption, ncol = 2) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#F1B1B5\", \"Yes\" = \"#97B3AE\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Lifestyle Mosaic: Smoking, Activity, and Alcohol vs. Heart Attack\",\n    subtitle = \"PA = Physical Activity.

Each facet represents a different alcohol consumption level (High, Moderate, Low, None).\nInterestingly, non-smokers who report no alcohol consumption but high physical activity exhibit one of the highest heart attack rates. Additionally, smokers with moderate physical activity tend to have higher heart attack rates compared to smokers with low or high physical activity.\n\n\n\nPairwise numeric plot (Health metrics)\nThis code uses ggpairs() to create a matrix of pairwise plots for all numeric variables in heart_data. The mapping = aes(color = Heart_Attack_Occurrence) argument adds a color-coded grouping by heart attack status.\n\n# Automatically select all numeric columns from the dataset\nnumeric_cols &lt;- sapply(heart_data, is.numeric)\n\npairwise_plot &lt;- ggpairs(\n  data = heart_data,\n  columns = which(numeric_cols),\n  mapping = aes(color = Heart_Attack_Occurrence),\n  lower = list(continuous = wrap(\"smooth\", alpha = 0.3, size = 0.5)),\n  diag = list(continuous = wrap(\"densityDiag\", alpha = 0.5)),\n  upper = list(continuous = wrap(\"cor\", size = 4))\n) +\n  ggtitle(\"Pairwise Correlations Among All Numeric Metrics\")\n\npairwise_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the plot\nThis grid compares health metrics like BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, and stress. The diagonal panels show density curves for each variable, revealing, for instance, that Age has a broader distribution compared to the other variables.\nThe upper panels list correlation coefficients and their significance, most of which are near zero (e.g., Corr: 0.025, 0.048), indicating that these variables do not strongly co-vary. In the lower scatter plots, points are colored by heart attack occurrence; no tight clustering suggests no single numeric threshold exclusively separates “Yes” vs. “No.” For instance, Systolic_BP and Diastolic_BP show little correlation as high Systolic_BP often coexists with both high and low Diastolic_BP. Overall, no single numeric factor stands out as a strictly linear driver of heart attack, though there may be subtle nonlinear or interactive effects to explore later."

However, these are less extreme than in the naïve model, suggesting the parameter estimates are more stable overall.\n\nLittle change to overall accuracy (AUC)\n\nWhile the model does somewhat better at identifying positives, the ROC curve remains fairly close to the diagonal, reflecting an AUC only slightly better than 0.5.\nIn other words, the model is still not very accurate overall, indicating that the available predictors may not strongly discriminate between “Yes” and “No”—or that we need further refinements (e.g., more complex interactions, alternative transformations, or additional data)."
