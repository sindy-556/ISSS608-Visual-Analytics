<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">1. Overview</h2>
<p>This document presents a comprehensive visualization prototype for GeBiz procurement data. It features two complementary analytical approaches: Sankey diagrams to visualize procurement flows from ministries to agencies to suppliers, and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment and evaluate supplier relationships. Together, these visualizations provide powerful insights into government procurement patterns and supplier management.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="loading-and-enriching-data">2.1 Loading and Enriching Data</h3>
<p>Before creating our visualizations, we need to load and prepare the relevant datasets. We’re working with with the GeBiz dataset and 2 other dataset that sourced online:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Procurement transaction data - the core dataset with details of each procurement activity from GeBiz</p></li>
<li><p>Supplier financial information - containing grading data for suppliers (note: this dataset is incomplete, as we were unable to obtain financial grades for all suppliers)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>3, Agency mapping data - providing the hierarchical relationships between agencies and ministries</p>
<p>The code below loads these datasets from CSV files into R data frames. We’ll need to handle the incomplete nature of the supplier financial data during our analysis.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="extracting-supplier-grades">2.2 Extracting Supplier Grades</h3>
<p>The <code>financial_df</code> dataset contains supplier grade information, which indicates the financial capacity of each supplier. The Singapore government classifies suppliers on a scale from S2 to S10, with each grade corresponding to specific monetary thresholds:</p>
<ul>
<li>S2: $100,000 (EPU S2)</li>
<li>S3: $250,000 (EPU S3)</li>
<li>S4: $500,000 (EPU S4)</li>
<li>S5: $1,000,000 (EPU S5)</li>
<li>S6: $3,000,000 (EPU S6)</li>
<li>S7: $5,000,000 (EPU S7)</li>
<li>S8: $10,000,000 (EPU S8)</li>
<li>S9: $30,000,000 (EPU S9)</li>
<li>S10: &gt;$30,000,000 (EPU S10)</li>
</ul>
<p>Higher grades (S8-S10) represent larger companies with greater financial capacity, while lower grades (S2-S4) represent smaller contractors.</p>

<p>Since we were unable to obtain financial grades for all suppliers in our procurement dataset, we’ll need to handle missing values appropriately in our analysis. We’ll need to account for the incomplete coverage in our visualizations and interpretations.</p>

<p>To create comprehensive visualizations, we need to combine all our datasets into one enriched procurement dataset. This includes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Adding supplier financial grades to the procurement records</li>
<li>Adding ministry information to the agencies</li>
<li>Creating standardized abbreviations for agencies and ministries for cleaner visualization</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="verifying-data-enrichment">2.4 Verifying Data Enrichment</h3>
<p>After joining the datasets, it’s important to verify that the enrichment was successful and understand the extent of missing data. The code below reports statistics on the completeness of our enriched dataset, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total number of procurement records</li>
<li>Records with financial grades (expected to be incomplete due to data limitations)</li>
<li>Records with agency abbreviations</li>
<li>Records with ministry information</li>
</ul>
<p>This verification step is particularly important given that we’re working with external datasets of varying completeness. Understanding these limitations will help us design appropriate visualizations and interpret results accurately.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="date-conversion-and-handling-missing-values">3.1 Date Conversion and Handling Missing Values</h3>
<p>We’ll perform several preprocessing steps to improve data quality:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Convert date strings to proper Date objects</li>
<li>Create a year field for filtering</li>
<li>Handle missing values in supplier names</li>
<li>Create financial grade categories for visualization</li>
</ol>
<p>For the financial grades, we’ll consolidate the nine different S-grades (S2-S10) into three more manageable categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small (S1-S4): Suppliers with financial capacity up to $500,000</li>
<li>Medium (S5-S7): Suppliers with financial capacity between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000</li>
<li>Large (S8-S10): Suppliers with financial capacity of $10,000,000 and above</li>
</ul>
<p>These preprocessing steps ensure our data is clean, properly formatted, and appropriately categorized for visualization.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-the-sankey-diagram-visualization">4. Building the Sankey Diagram Visualization</h2>
<p>The heart of our visualization is the create_sankey() function defined below. This function creates a Sankey diagram showing the flow of procurement funds from ministries to agencies to suppliers.</p>
<p>The function is highly customizable, allowing users to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter by year, ministry, agency, or supplier</li>
<li>Show only the top K ministries, agencies, or suppliers by procurement value</li>
<li>Set a minimum value threshold to include only significant flows</li>
<li>Enable debug mode for troubleshooting when developing the Shiny application</li>
</ul>
<p>This customizability makes the function valuable for exploring different aspects of the procurement network.</p>

<p>The <code>create_sankey()</code> function is highly customizable through various parameters that control filtering, display options, and performance.</p>
<p>Filtering parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>year_filter</code>: Numeric or NULL. Filter records by a specific year (e.g., 2023). If NULL (default), all years are included.</li>
<li><code>ministry_filter</code>: Character vector or NULL. Filter by specific ministry names. If NULL (default), top ministries are selected based on top_k_ministries.</li>
<li><code>agency_filter</code>: Character vector or NULL. Filter by specific agency names. If NULL (default), top agencies are selected based on <code>top_k_agencies</code>.</li>
<li><code>supplier_filter</code>: Character vector or NULL. Filter by specific supplier names or categories (depending on <code>group_by_grade</code>). If NULL (default), top suppliers are selected based on <code>top_k_suppliers</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Top-k selection parameters:</p>

<section id="rfm-analysis-parameters" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rfm-analysis-parameters">RFM Analysis Parameters</h4>
<p>The <code>create_rfm_analysis()</code> function offers extensive customization through various parameters that control filtering, segmentation granularity, and output configuration. Understanding these parameters is crucial for effectively tailoring the RFM analysis to specific analytical needs.</p>
<p>Filtering Parameters</p>
<ul>
<li><code>year_filter</code>: Numeric or NULL. Restricts analysis to a specific year. When NULL (default), all years are included.</li>
<li><code>ministry_filter</code>: Character vector or NULL. Limits analysis to specific ministries. When NULL (default), all ministries are included.</li>
<li><code>agency_filter</code>: Character vector or NULL. Restricts analysis to specific agencies. When NULL (default), all agencies are included.</li>
<li><code>supplier_filter</code>: Character vector or NULL. Limits analysis to specific suppliers. When NULL (default), all suppliers are included.</li>
</ul>
<p>Value and Sample Size Controls</p>
<ul>
<li><code>min_monetary_value</code>: Numeric, default 10,000. Sets the minimum procurement value threshold for including a supplier in the analysis. Suppliers with total values below this threshold are excluded to focus on significant relationships.</li>
<li><code>max_suppliers</code>: Numeric, default 1,000. Limits the number of suppliers included in visualization outputs. If the number of suppliers exceeds this value, a stratified sample is selected to maintain representation across segments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Segmentation Controls</p>
<ul>
<li><code>recency_quartiles</code>: Numeric, default 4. Sets the number of segments for the recency dimension. Higher values create more granular segmentation.</li>
<li><code>frequency_quartiles</code>: Numeric, default 4. Sets the number of segments for the frequency dimension. Higher values create more granular segmentation.</li>
<li><code>monetary_quartiles</code>: Numeric, default 4. Sets the number of segments for the monetary value dimension. Higher values create more granular segmentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional Options</p>
<ul>
<li><code>include_financial_grade</code>: Logical, default TRUE. When TRUE, incorporates supplier financial grade information into the RFM analysis, enabling correlation between financial capacity and procurement behavior.</li>
<li><code>analysis_date</code>: Date or NULL. Specifies the reference date for calculating recency (days since last contract). When NULL (default), uses the most recent date in the dataset plus one day.</li>
<li><code>debug</code>: Logical, default FALSE. When TRUE, outputs diagnostic messages during analysis to assist with troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>
<p>The function outputs a comprehensive list containing: - <code>rfm_data</code>: Complete RFM analysis for all suppliers - <code>rfm_sample</code>: A sample of suppliers for visualization (limited by max_suppliers) - <code>segment_summary</code>: Aggregated metrics for each RFM segment - <code>analysis_date</code>: The reference date used for recency calculations</p>

<section id="creating-rfm-visualizations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-rfm-visualizations">7.2 Creating RFM Visualizations</h3>
<p>Various visualization functions to represent RFM analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>create_rfm_heatmap()</code>: Visualizes the distribution of suppliers across RFM scores</li>
<li><code>create_rfm_bubble_chart()</code>: Maps suppliers across the RFM dimensions</li>
<li><code>create_segment_distribution()</code>: Compares supplier count vs.&nbsp;procurement value</li>
<li><code>create_grade_segment_heatmap()</code>: Shows the relationship between financial grades and RFM segments</li>
<li><code>create_rfm_datatable()</code>: Provides an interactive table of RFM analysis results</li>
